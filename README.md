# Ford-Johnson Visualizer

An interactive web application that visualizes the **Ford-Johnson (Merge-Insertion) sorting algorithm** step by step.

The project helps understand how the algorithm minimizes comparisons by showing:
- pair formation and ordering
- recursive merging
- Jacobsthal insertion sequence
- comparison flow and data states in real time

🌐 **Live Demo:**

## Purpose

This visualizer was built to deeply explore one of the most comparison-efficient sorting algorithms and make its complex logic intuitive through visualization.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features
- Step-by-step execution
- Visual comparison tracking
- Dynamic sequence visualization
- Educational algorithm breakdown
